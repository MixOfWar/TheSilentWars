        The art of conversation isn't something that comes easily to everyone.
        In fact most people struggle in some way with conversing, especially
        with strangers. However, one of the biggest parts of doing research in
        design is interviewing. Interviewing allows us a peer inside the lives
        of the people we are trying to help, it allows us to look at the world
        through their eyes and get a better grasp of how we can help without our
        own views getting in the way. In this way it is a
        <strong>very</strong> important part of the design process and one that
        cannot be easily skipped over. Without understanding the people we are
        trying to help, how can we even begin to understand the problem. The
        simple answer? We can't. <br /><br />
        Now there are a multitude of different ways that you can approach an
        interview, you can aim for a casual conversation, or you can aim for a
        more aggressive question after question based interview, it's going to
        depend on your style. Today, I'm going to talk about my experience with
        interviews and what worked best for me this week. I feel like at this
        point I shouldn't have to clarify this but I'm going to anyway.

            >I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN UX DESIGN, I AM A STUDENT PASSING ON MY
            EXPERIENCES.</em
          ></strong
        >
        I just feel like it's important to remember that just because something
        works for me, or I like a specific thing doesn't mean that it will work
        for everyone, or that it's what you should do, and definitely doesn't
        make it the industry standard.. <br /><br />
        My favorite approach so far, and I've tried a few, is just the casual
        conversation approach. This can probably be attributed to the fact that
        I am a pretty outgoing person but I have found that even when I'm
        interviewing people who are introverted that this has produced the most
        in depth answers and really opens up the ability to truly empathize with
        the people that I am interviewing. In this way I can really focus on
        their answers using my questions as more of a guideline, while really
        getting to the core of their perspective. When you're trying to solve
        someone else's problem you have to be able to put yourself in their
        shoes and walk around a bit. You need to be able to look at the issue
        from a place outside your own views, and set aside what you think you
        know about the solution. In this way you can really get to the core of
        the issue(s) and start to address what the people need, and how you can
        make that happen, which is, after all, the point of interviewing.
        <br /><br />
        Now there are a few things you have to keep in mind. When you conduct an
        interview people, no matter what you do, will try to produce their best
        self, so what they say and what they do can differ at times, and that's
        okay, as long as you're aware of it. It's also important to remember
        that generally speaking the people you're interviewing aren't designers,
        so don't take their feedback as gospel. I have personally found it
        interesting to figure out what people have used prior, how that did or
        didn't work for them, and what changes they think they would have made,
        but if you aren't careful that can lead you into a trap of features that
        don't really work in the long run. However, letting people talk about
        their ideas can also help you backtrack to the problem in a different
        way, letting you glean more information than just asking the standard
        interview questions.
        <br /><br />
        Other than that, it's really about making sure that you can record the
        interview to really see people's responses, making sure that your
        questions are giving you a good picture of the problem from the people's
        view, and just being thorough. All of these things together will
        complete your picture and give you the best opportunity to be the
        problem solver you're trying to be. After all, UX Design/Engineering is
        really just the ability to solve problems in the most efficient way
        possible. In this way you're not only good at your job but you're doing
        a valuable service both for the company you work for, and the people
        that company serves.
        <br /><br />
        Now I'm off to write more notes, hopefully conduct more interviews, and
        start working on solving the problem I'm currently working on. See you
        all next week!
