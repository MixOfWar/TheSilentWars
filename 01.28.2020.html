      <h1>My First Day ...</h1>
      <img src="Images/firstday.webp" alt="Nemo saying first day of school" />
      <p>
        Today is my first day of school in years.
        <br /><br />
        I don't really know how I am supposed to feel but I know that I am
        excited beyond measure to start this particular adventure. I haven't
        been in school in around 7-8 years and when you go that long between
        being in a "learning institution" you fall out of habit of this
        particular style of learning.
        <br /><br />
        I've always been an independent learner, meaning even when I was going
        to school regularly I didn't learn as well with the class as I did
        pursuing the knowledge on my own. The main difference between then and
        now is not only my own age but also the subject matter. See coding is
        quite the different beast when it comes to learning. I cannot explain
        how many times in my coding adventure my knowledge was blessed with the
        input of friends and other students. Seeing the many different ways that
        people think of coding and how they logic out the same problem with so
        many different solutions leading to the same end is amazing and eye
        opening.
        <br /><br />
        I am writing all of this about an hour before class starts. Today truly
        is my first day at
        <a href="https://www.kenzie.academy/" target="_blank">Kenzie Academy</a
        >, and while I am nervous, I am counting down the minutes until class
        starts because I am impatient. I've been eager for learning as long as I
        can remember but the passion I have for coding has changed the entire
        game for me. I couldn't be more thankful to finally be starting on the
        adventure I started when I was 13. I will be working towards not only my
        own knowledge but being able to pursue teaching as well, which is a
        passion of mine that I am finally able to properly pursue. <br /><br />
        This is just the beginning ....
        <br /><br />
        But what a beginning it is.
