        This is the start of my newest adventure. Along with going to school
        full-time to become certified in my dream job, I am taking on the task
        of documenting my journey, from accomplishments to failures. The point
        of this is to *hopefully* inspire others to pursue their dreams, and as
        always to make the world a little more accessible for everyone. I want
        to normalize the process and show that no matter your talents, there
        will be struggles, but you can overcome them. No one promised that this
        life would be easy, no one promised us everything, but if you shoot for
        the moon, at least you'll land among the stars.
