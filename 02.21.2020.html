      <p>
        Brainstorming, brings up a lot of mixed feelings and experiences doesn't
        it? Most people remember brainstorming in grade school but the fact of
        the matter is it's become a lot more refined than it used to be. Today
        I'm going to go over my top three favorite styles of brainstorming and
        why they're my favorites. I usually use all three when brainstorming for
        a project.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>Method 1: Brain Dump</h2>
      <p>
        Brain Dumps are one of the few things that are very similar to what it
        sounds like. The idea behind brain dumps is to get out every thought
        related to the project or product, both good and bad. Take a piece of
        paper (or a few) and write out every idea that comes to mind, if you
        stall reread what you have and continue on. In this way you can really
        let the creativity flow without limiting yourself or others to the
        constraints of what you think the solution should look like. Brain dumps
        also spark conversations about what you're looking for in a "good"
        solution, and what you aren't looking for i.e. a "bad" solution. It is
        especially key to remember that sometimes the "bad" idea is what sparks
        the final solution, sometimes the "bad" idea sets new parameters that
        you hadn't previously considered and by letting that out others can
        build it into something amazing.

      <h2>Method 2: Worst Possible Idea</h2>
      <p>
        The idea behind the Worst Possible Idea is to define the parameters of
        what you do not want included in the solution. For this brainstorming
        method you really just write or talk out the worst possible solutions
        and use them to refine the ideas in method 1. By doing this you're
        looking at the good and the bad of the solutions proposed and figuring
        out ways to get around the bad, but expand upon the good. It's a
        beautiful refinement technique and can help lower the tension allowing
        for more creativity to flow.
      </p>

      <h2>Method 3: Mind Map</h2>
      <p>
        For this method we are going to take the ideas from method 1 that we
        didn't lose in method 2 and define them by their features. Combine the
        solutions that are similar or refer to the same feature, then write them
        all out in a way that flows. When you make a mind map you start with the
        problem in the middle, then put the needs/features as offshoots of the
        problem, then put the solutions under the needs/features they deal with.
        This helps to refine what each solution pertains to, you can condense
        the solutions, and really see the beginnings of the ultimate solution.
        This will also be the point where you can really iterate the final idea
        forms of the solutions and start getting a bigger picture of the entire
        solution in and of itself.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        By combining these methods, whether you're working with a team, or
        individually, you'll find that you can really refine your ideas and come
        up with a workable solution. Using these methods within the design
        process can help you move onto the next step without getting stuck on
        the ideation phase. Hopefully you all find this useful, as for me I'll
        be enjoying my weekend and getting ready for the next phase of this
        learning process. Enjoy your weekend!
