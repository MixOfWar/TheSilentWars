      <h1>I'm Sensing A Theme ...</h1>

        Another week down and I'm starting to recognize a theme at this school.
        I'm not only thoroughly enjoying my time within my class settings, but
        I'm actively learning each week and am almost constantly having fun. Now
        I like learning probably more than your average person. I consume
        information like most people breathe, however, it's been a while since I
        could honestly say that I was completely enjoying the method by which I
        am learning. There is so much that is challenging and difficult but it's
        all in a good way that pushes you outside your comfort zone and forces
        you to grow as you proceed through the class. Beyond that I've gotten to
        really know quite a few of my classmates and I really am enjoying all
        the different perspectives coming out of this class.
        <br /><br />
        This week we did a design sprint in groups. The idea behind a design
        sprint is that sometimes we tend, as designers, to overthink things and
        spend way too much time working on a particular issue. In comes design
        sprints where you bust out an entire solution in a week by following a
        fluid game plan from start to finish. There's 5 stages to a design
        sprint and I'll do my best to explain the process.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Empathize:</h2>
      <p>
        I lovingly call this stage the research stage. See the idea is to set
        aside everything that you think you know about the problem and look at
        it with new eyes. Depending on the amount of time you have this stage
        can be very superficial, to a crazy amount of information. The important
        part is that you spend time gathering resources from different
        locations, it's okay if some of the information is the same but you
        really want to make sure you get a broad range of information to better
        help you to work on the next step.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Define:</h2>
      <p>
        This part of the process is about analyzing the information, really
        getting to the pit of the problem and to start assessing functions or
        features that will help your users combat the problem efficiently. This
        part does build some assumptions because you have to have something to
        test before you put it in front of people but that's okay because we are
        going to test those assumptions with actual people to see if we get it
        right. The more complete your information is from step 1, the better
        this information will be.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Ideate:</h2>
      <p>
        I think this is my favorite part, you let the creative juices flow and
        just try to solve the problem. Big ideas, small ideas, little features,
        big functions, just get those ideas out there. Then you take time to go
        over them, pick the ones that appear the most, the repeats and really
        look at the outliers and see which ones should just be included, which
        have cool elements that you might want to include, and which are just
        going to have to wait until another time. This process is so interesting
        because you have a bunch of people who just went over the same
        information and sometimes you come to similar conclusions and sometimes
        you end up on polar opposite ends, but it's all valid, and wonderful.
        Ok, nevermind, we all know this is my favorite part.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Prototype:</h2>
      <p>
        Now we get to build it, *insert evil laugh here*. No but really, you get
        to build a framing of how you and your team want the app to look. Here
        we're focusing on user interaction and showing them what you've come up
        with as a team. We want to focus on things they can give feedback on and
        the main aspects of the solution. You don't want to be overly detailed
        but you want to give enough information that people can really get a
        feel for how the solution is going to help them solve this particular
        problem and the key features/functions to make sure that it's accessible
        and user friendly. Remember that the main thing this will lead to is
        feedback and you'll be on the right track.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Test:</h2>
      <p>
        No this isn't the part where you take a test on it, I promise. This is
        the part where you take your prototype to people and see if they can
        navigate what you have created. Look for critics here, separate yourself
        from the product and really let people play with it, and figure it out.
        This is both the hardest part and also the most rewarding. See
        inevitably you haven't created a perfect product because that doesn't
        exist, but you will have created something tangible that people can
        really grasp and understand. TAKE NOTES!!!!! I cannot stress how
        important this is, and if at all possible record the interaction because
        watching people navigate your product is almost more important than what
        they say about it (almost). Then compile all this information and start
        making the changes needed, and really refining your product.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        And that's it, from here you'll continue to refine the product and then
        get all your developers behind it and start producing the product.
        That's a fun sentence. All in all this process can put you through the
        ringer but it's also a <strong>WONDERFUL</strong> experience. If you go
        into it with an open mind and remember that the critics are not about
        you personally you will create an amazing product that can help many
        people, and they'll want to use it. <br /><br />
        With that all said I'm going to go enjoy my weekend. I'm really looking
        forward to next week's curriculum and getting back to class. Hope you
        all get a chance to relax and really enjoy some time this weekend. Until
        next time.
