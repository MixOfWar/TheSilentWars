        <p>
          There were so many things we learned in just three short months. From the design sprint we started with to the
          prototype of the app we ended with, we really pushed our understanding of each skill we were taught. We
          refreshed topics that I had already breached while also delving into topics I never thought to cover. With all
          that said, there is so much that I want to learn more about, and so many skills that I need to expand on that
          I don’t feel like this essay will cover everything I should work on. However, with that being said, and
          staying within the parameters of what I want this work to entail, here are the skills I need to work on, and
          the skills I want to really examine and develop further. A recap of the first three months if you will. Three
          skills I need to work on, and three skills I want to learn more about.
          <br /><br />
          The first, and biggest skill, I really should work on is writing out my research questions. The problem I ran
          into each time we did this particular task was that while I could write the research questions out, I could
          really only do it after writing my interview questions, then pulling from those and figuring out what I was
          really trying to answer. I spent a lot of time analyzing biases in my questions, if they were leading, pulling
          that information out to write my research questions and then going back and rewriting my questions for my
          interviews so they didn’t reflect the bias and were no longer leading. This became an arduous process and made
          writing research questions really unpleasant. No matter how I tried I couldn’t do this in another way and I
          truly think that’s just because I really need to develop this skill or learn to think of it in another way.
          <br /><br />
          Another skill I struggled with was proximity. When I started this course I had a vague understanding of what
          this skill entailed but I tended to overcompensate for it instead of letting proximity speak for itself. I’ve
          since learned a good deal about this skill but I still feel as though I could learn more and really refine
          this skill. Understanding how visuals impact what you see on the screen and how it’s grouped in the mind is so
          important no matter if you’re developing for apps or web design. It’s a skill I can’t afford to neglect.
          <br /><br />
          Finally color hierarchy is the last skill I struggled with, for obvious reasons. Having issues with color
          differentiation is both a hindrance and a strength in this respect. I’m acutely aware when colors are too
          close to have adequate contrast but in the same respect I sometimes chose colors that clashed because of my
          inability to truly see colors how others do. There are a lot of accessible references for this, but I need to
          learn to use them more often, and probably memorize them if we’re being honest. This is something I’ll get
          better with in time, but until that point it is going to continue to be something I need to work on.
          <br /><br />
          The first of the skills I would really like to learn more about is interviewing. As I mentioned when I was
          going over research questions, there was way too much refinement going on in this stage (or so I felt) and I’d
          like to get better at doing these things in the correct manner or at least in an efficient one. I’m very
          talkative as well, and tend to talk fast, which can be a skill in certain situations but more often than not
          it makes communication difficult. I want to learn to speak clearly and really refine my ability to be
          understood in interviewing. This will translate well into other parts of my career but is most important when
          trying to glean needed information from users in an efficient manner.
          <br /><br />
          The second of these skills is the use of white space. I think this will help me with proximity as well. I tend
          to want to put a lot of information on a single page, and can obsess over the fact that I have “more space” to
          use, when in fact I know that white space really does help the users to focus on what they need to on each
          page. So far I’m still struggling with how much space is good space. I hope with learning more about white
          space I’ll be more ready to use it in a competent way that is visually pleasing.
          <br /><br />
          Finally the third, and last, of these skills is using a search function. Initially when I was designing my
          app, I had a search function in the app, but found that it was unnecessary. In the last couple of weeks I
          ended up removing it completely and instead going back to an original design that I had scrapped early in the
          design process to replace it. I think if I had understood more about the search function I could have
          eliminated the time I spent on it that ended up feeling wasted. Knowing the parameters of where search is
          useful and where it isn’t will help me make better decisions about the use of the search function in the
          future, and hopefully help my users.
          <br /><br />
          All in all, this is a class and we are constantly learning and refining skills as we go along. New information
          we get later in the course can change the way we look at things we learned in the beginning, which is well
          reflected in the design changes our apps go through. Every iteration of our application shows the growth we
          make and that is exciting but also cements what we’re learning in a valuable way. For now, from proximity to
          interviewing, I will continue to absorb as much information as I can, but I know that this list may change as
          we move into quarter two. I look forward to what the next quarter will teach us and hope that I can put it all
          together into a wonderful design process by the end of this all.
