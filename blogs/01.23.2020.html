          I had my first loss of information! I am still not quite sure what
          happened but I ended up losing all of my website information. Shocking
          I know but I was mad for all of about 2.5 seconds before I recognized
          this for the opportunity it was. It gave me a chance to redo some
          information and really look at how I was building this site, spoiler
          alert: I was doing it the difficult way. Let me explain.
          <br /><br />
          When you make a webpage, each part of the information goes into things
          called elements, and you can name these elements. My idea of
          organizing was naming each individual element like it was going out of
          style, so while I was rebuilding I took the opportunity to really look
          at the elements I was using and try to figure out how I could
          streamline the process. I write all of this in html and the issue
          there is that I format everything as I go. Now I don't have to. I've
          streamlined the process to ease my workload and make it easier to do
          what I am thoroughly enjoying doing.
          <br /><br />
          This also gave me a chance to add a "beautification" process and add
          some elements to the background and each element that I feel gave the
          website a little more depth. You are more than welcome to check out
          the source code by right clicking the webpage and clicking "View page
          source" to bring it up in another window. If you're just learning to
          code it can be very informative to check out the pages you enjoy and
          really just delving into the coding of each page. Soon I will do a
          walkthrough of how I built this website so stay tuned for that
          information if that's something that interests you. For now, I am
          going to sign off. It's been a long, but enjoyable day.
