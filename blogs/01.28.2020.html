        <h1>My First Day ...</h1>
        <img src="/images/firstday.webp" alt="Nemo saying first day of school" />
        <p>
          Today is my first day of school in years.
          <br /><br />
          I don't really know how I am supposed to feel but I know that I am excited beyond measure to start this
          particular adventure. I haven't been in school in around 7-8 years and when you go that long between being in
          a "learning institution" you fall out of habit of this particular style of learning.
          <br /><br />
          I've always been an independent learner, meaning even when I was going to school regularly I didn't learn as
          well with the class as I did pursuing the knowledge on my own. The main difference between then and now is not
          only my own age but also the subject matter. See coding is quite the different beast when it comes to
          learning. I cannot explain how many times in my coding adventure my knowledge was blessed with the input of
          friends and other students. Seeing the many different ways that people think of coding and how they logic out
          the same problem with so many different solutions leading to the same end is amazing and eye opening.
          <br /><br />
          I am writing all of this about an hour before class starts. Today truly is my first day at
          <a href="https://www.kenzie.academy/" target="_blank">Kenzie Academy</a>, and while I am nervous, I am
          counting down the minutes until class starts because I am impatient. I've been eager for learning as long as I
          can remember but the passion I have for coding has changed the entire game for me. I couldn't be more thankful
          to finally be starting on the adventure I started when I was 13. I will be working towards not only my own
          knowledge but being able to pursue teaching as well, which is a passion of mine that I am finally able to
          properly pursue. <br /><br />
          This is just the beginning ....
          <br /><br />
          But what a beginning it is.
