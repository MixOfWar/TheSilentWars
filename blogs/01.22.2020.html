        <p>
          This morning I was blessed to be included in a meeting to help women
          in tech hosted by
          <a href="https://www.thisdot.co/this-js" target="_blank">ThisDot</a>
          (you can find them on twitter
          <a href="https://twitter.com/ThisDotMedia" target="_blank">here</a>).
          Their CEO and co-founder,
          <a href="https://twitter.com/ladyleet" target="_blank">Tracy</a>, as
          well as one of their software developers,
          <a href="https://twitter.com/psybercity" target="_blank">Katerina</a
          >,took the lead helping those of us who attended with all sorts of
          questions and problem-solving. Their goal? To help create a more
          inclusive space and give back to the people they're creating that
          space for! <br /><br />
          Now, while the meeting was very helpful and I cannot adequately
          express my gratitude to these amazing women for the resources they
          provided, there's something else about this I'd like to talk about:
          their goal. To give back is a personally wonderful thing, but it is
          also extremely valuable when you're talking about helping people move
          forward in their careers. One of my favorite quotes about helping
          others is one from Audrey Hepburn: "As you grow older, you will
          discover that you have two hands: one for helping yourself, the other
          for helping others." This is an important view because no one is truly
          "self-made"; everyone used the resources and people around them to get
          where they are. Endeavoring to pour back into the resources that you
          found helpful, or directly helping people in general to get to where
          you are helps expand their network, and as we all know, networking is
          important when you're in tech.
          <br /><br />
          Now, you may be wondering why I'm making a big deal about this, and I
          have no problem explaining. It's easy to get caught up in work and
          your own life, but there are so many reasons that you should mentor
          others in one fashion or another.
          <br /><br />
          For one, it's going to challenge you. When you learn something for
          yourself, you learn, comprehend, and move on. When you learn to teach,
          however, you learn, comprehend, challenge that learning, teach,
          reassess, and reach complete comprehension. It will also open you up
          to different viewpoints on solving the problem, which helps you expand
          how you can apply the solution.
          <br /><br />
          Second, you're expanding the resources for the next generation of
          people doing what you do. When you think back to when you started and
          the resources you used, you probably remember how difficult you found
          it and how hard you had to work to get access to some of those very
          important resources. Adding to that by giving back makes it that much
          more accessible for the next generation, meaning you're helping
          streamline their learning, making it more efficient.
          <br /><br />
          Third, you're networking, building relationships with people that open
          doors to new opportunities.
          <br /><br />
          And finally, you're sharing your story, which is one of the most
          important things we can do as people. Many people think they can't do
          what they dream of for whatever reason is holding them back. By
          sharing your story, you can reach those people and show them that
          there is no limit to what you can do when you apply yourself. You can
          directly, openly, and gently change the industry you are in by opening
          up accessibility just by sharing who you are as a person and what
          drives you.
          <br /><br />
          Accessibility is one of the biggest struggles, but it is
          <strong>SO</strong> worth it. There are a million ideas that are never
          heard because of the limitations of accessibility. When we open that
          door for others, we open ourselves to growth, and we level the playing
          field for the ideas that will change the world in a positive way. This
          is why accessibility should be a priority in every field. The only
          constant in this world is change. If we want to make sure that change
          is positive, we need to invite everyone to the table, not just the
          able elite few. It is through this change that we will move forward as
          people and as a society. It is through accessibility that we ensure
          this change benefits all people--from all walks and all backgrounds.
          <br /><br />
          So when you find yourself moving forward in life, remember, you have
          two hands for a reason: one for helping yourself, and one for helping
          others.
