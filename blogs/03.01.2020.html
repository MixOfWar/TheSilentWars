        <h1>When Health Hits Home ...</h1>
        <img src="../images/shrug.gif" alt="Lady Shrugging" />
        <p>
          Well my health has chosen an inconvenient time to crop up and cause
          issues. Hence the late post this week. With everything going on
          between school, the HTML class I'm teaching, the squads I both lead
          and participate in, it really wasn't the time, still isn't. Alas, here
          I am dealing with my health issues rearing their heads reminding me
          that this is a degenerative disease and I have to stay on top of it.
          <br /><br />
          While this hasn't stopped me, in the slightest, from participating in
          most everything that I am involved in, it has made it hard to want to
          sit and write, because while I usually blog about school and what
          we're learning, this week its hard to focus on anything but how my
          health is injecting itself into every part of my life. So this week is
          (obviously) a health and living post, next week will probably be
          either a longer post covering both weeks or two seperate posts, I'll
          cross that bridge when I get there.
          <br /><br />
          So lets talk about the big scary elephant in the room: My Health.
          <br /><br />
          I've already gone over the fact that I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and
          that it comes with comorbities, but today we are going to talk about
          some of those, how they're effecting my day to day, and how I'm
          managing them.
          <br /><br />
          First off lets talk about a long love of mine (note the sarcasm) POTS.
          POTS is the short term for a syndrome known as Postural Orthostatic
          Tachycardia Syndrome (more info
          <a href="http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30"
            >here</a
          >) is a type of orthostatic intolerance, in laymen terms, when a
          person with POTS stands, their body does some weird stuff. POTS is a
          type of dysautonomia which just means that it's a problem with the
          automatic nervous system which runs things like your blood pressure,
          heart rate, and breathing. The things you don't think about but you're
          body has to do anyways. The diagnostic criteria is that you get
          tachycardia (high heart rate) when going from a sitting to standing
          position (among other things). Some people pass out, Some people get
          nauseated, there's a lot of things that can happen for people with
          POTS but as I said, the above is the <strong>main</strong> diagnostic
          criteria. <br /><br />
          Now that we have that down lets talk about one of the rarer things I
          deal with, Aquagenic urticaria (more info
          <a
            href="https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10901/aquagenic-urticaria"
            >here</a
          >), AKA, my water allergy. When I drink water I throw up, when it
          touches my skin I get hives and I <strong>ITCH</strong> everywhere but
          usually more so on my chest, neck, and legs. So as you can imagine I
          spend much of my time dehydrated. Guess what makes, POTS worse, three
          tries the first two don't count. Yea, dehydration. So as you can
          imagine this is a terror to deal with. I drink a lot of tea, coffee
          (without sugar and cream) and diluted juices, but I cannot intake
          enough without either a, triggering the allergy, or b, triggering my
          gastroparesis. I'm just very limited on what I can do. This seems to
          be compounding and causing a lot of issues with my body, and I'm
          finding my movements very limited with these two issues. <br /><br />
          Here's another fun one, when you get dehydrated your muscles start to
          starve. Proper hydration is required to get oxygen and nutrients to
          your muscles but because I'm not properly hydrated, my muscles are
          suffering, so I'm dealing with some atrophy which is painful but my
          muscles also aren't recovering as well after each of my many daily
          dislocations which means they're happening more frequently. And the
          muscle spasms. I'm over it. To combat this I'm doing a lot of bracing,
          a lot of resting, and a lot of changing positions to keep my muscles
          from spasming until the joints fall apart. It's helpful but doesn't
          always catch everything. Then theres the migraines, and stomach
          issues, so on and so forth.
          <br /><br />
          It's a lot, and there's more that goes into it but I won't bore you
          with the details. The basis is, this stuff happens, a lot, especially
          to disabled people. But I also bring all this up to point out an
          important fact. While I have had to be more dilligent about where I am
          spending my time, it has not taken away from my ability to do all the
          special things I do, school, teaching, squads, because I do all that
          remotely. I don't need specialty accomodations for my health because I
          work remotely. I don't have to take time off for my doctors
          appointments because I work remotely and so get to maneuver my
          schedule a bit. I don't have to waste time, energy, and effort on
          getting up, showering (ow), doing my makeup, dressing a certain way,
          packing my laptop and things for work, loading my wheelchair, driving
          to work, unloading my wheelchair, and bringing all of my stuff to work
          with me, because I work remotely. I can still do the things I need to.
          If I have meetings, I do my makeup and dress in work appropriate
          attire. But I do not have to do things everyday that to others may
          seem simple but for me, just aren't. There's a lot that goes on for me
          each and every day but I've never been so happy to be pursuing the
          career I am now because no matter what life throws at me, I can
          accomodate myself, adapt my environment, and still be the badass
          person I know I can be.
          <br /><br />
          I still have a lot of maintinence to do for my health and more than a
          few doctors appointments to attend in the coming weeks, but I'll get
          it done, even if the way I do it is unconventional to most. Tech is
          amazing, and it's opening doors I had long lost hope for. So until
          next time, keep fighting, you never know where you're next fight will
          lead you.
