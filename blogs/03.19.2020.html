          Amid a global pandemic, the US is now enforcing social distancing and this means that many people for the first time are now experiencing life in isolation. A few things before I get into this. I AM NOT a medical professional, I am an immunocompromised member of this society but that doesn’t make me a medical professional. However, with that said, there’s a few things here that should be gone over. Social distancing is necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19. Wash your hands, stop touching your face, avoid groups of more than 10 people if you must be in a group at all and for the love of yourself, stop touching people. I’ll include some links at the bottom of this blog if you want to stay up to date on what’s going on. 
        <br><br>
          Now that that is out of the way, let's talk about the important part, how do you get through isolation without feeling isolated. Now since you’re on my blog I’m going to assume you at least have rudimentary access to the internet, which should be your best friend in these times. There’s a lot of free resources for learning here, among entertainment, and other pastimes, but we’re going to talk about effective socialization via the internet. 
        <br><br>
          Messenger, Hangouts, Zoom, and many other platforms offer video calls, use this. You are alone in your home but you don’t have to be. Message or call some friends and schedule “lunch dates” where you get your lunch together and sit down on a video call and discuss your days, your frustrations, your victories. You can do this with lunches, dinners, breakfasts, brunches, whatever works for you. If you have kids you can schedule play dates this way, kids are enamoured with technology, use that in a constructive way to keep them socialized and engaged. Video call your friends with kids, put your phone in a place where the kids can see and be seen but can’t touch (even if that means holding the phone) and allow them to talk to their friends. I admit that it isn’t the same as having a friend come over but it does help the isolation feel less isolating. 
        <br><br>
          Use computers if you can, they handle the video calls a little better for the most part and allow a little easier control over the video call. You can also use this to schedule “get togethers” with your friend group. Grab a glass of wine and video call a few friends, sit and chat together, laugh together, and yes vent together. 
        <br><br>
          These outlets are important for your mental health, for your kids and families, and most important they ensure a close connection with your community in a way that is safe for everyone. Yes, we’re in isolation. Yes, it sucks. But you aren’t alone, we can be alone together, and help each other through this scary time, responsibly.
        <br><br>
          Wash your hands.
          Practice social distancing.
          And call a friend, you deserve it.
