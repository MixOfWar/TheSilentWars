        <h1>My First Week ...</h1>
        <img src="/images/mindblown.gif" alt="Jeff Goldblum indicating his mind is blown" />
        <p>
          This has been quite the week, though mostly orientation, this week has not only introduced new concepts but so
          many new people. It has opened my eyes to a lot of things but mostly I have finally found which direction I
          want my career with UX Engineering to go. I will preface this by saying that this will surprise no one, but
          I've decided that I want to specialize in accessibility in design. This is exciting to me, and I hope it is
          exciting to others. It's a hard specialization to push for absolute inclusion but I feel it is a field worth
          pursuing.
          <br /><br />
          Obviously, this specialization has personal significance to me, but it also impacts those who can't always
          advocate for themselves, who are often left out of the conversation even when it impacts them the most.
          Through my own networking I have the resources to reach these people in a way that allows them to participate
          without requirements that may be outside of their physical capabilities, and/or daily allotment of energy.
          This is something that isn't often considered when designing and I believe that it should be. Some of the most
          amazing artistry I've ever seen, some of the most inclusive designs, and some of the purest love comes from
          those who are forgotten by the abled world. We are more than our disability, that we can still somehow exist
          in a world that isn't designed to be friendly to us in the least. I want to bridge this gap, to connect our
          day to day life with a way that is more conducive to complete inclusion, and bring these wonderful people to
          the light of society and allow them the platform to contribute in their own way. We can only do this through
          inclusion.
          <br /><br />
          On a side note, this doesn't mean that I won't be learning all aspects of design, but this does mean that I
          will bring this part of design to everything that I do. I'm enjoying the design process and it's given me many
          ideas not only about future designs but about designs I've already started or integrated. Design goes in so
          many directions but requires a certain amount of empathy to be truly useful. To design something you must
          first understand why it's needed, who needs it, what they're particular needs are, and how what you're
          designing can be most useful to meeting these needs. It's a lot of ground to cover and can be overwhelming to
          some, but that is the task of the designer, to find out these needs, to research and assess them, problem
          solve to find solutions, and then integrate those solutions into a product that not only solves the issues but
          also looks good while doing it. It's a big job but I am 100% here for it.
          <br /><br />
          So to clarify, this first week has been a lot, overwhelming at times, but it has been an amazing experience so
          far. The resources are limitless, everyone is so helpful, and learning from my peers keeps me from getting
          caught in my own perspective. I am exhausted but that is mostly from switching to this new schedule, it will
          take a little longer to be fully used to it. I am excited for what the next week holds let alone where this
          journey is taking me. Wherever I may go I know that I will take my love for design and culture with me. Time
          to take another step towards my career, can't wait to see where it leads.
