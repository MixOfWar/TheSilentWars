        So if you've checked out my <a href="about">About</a> Me section, then
        you'll probably know most of what I'm about to tell you, but for those
        who don't, I'll explain it here. <br /><br />
        The reason I started this blog goes back a little ways, like back to the
        beginning of my coding days, about 13 years ago. See, I fell in love
        with coding my freshman year of high school. I'm from a small town in
        Alaska called Homer, and while I love many things about my home state,
        there wasn't a push for technically inclined people when I lived there,
        especially in my hometown. So I ended up diverted from the path I wanted
        to take to appease my family and their friends. I wouldn't necessarily
        say I regret that decision because it led to some great experiences that
        I wouldn't trade for the world, but I wondered for a long time what
        would happen were I to pick up my old love again.
        <br /><br />
        After breaking out into the world and starting my own family, I learned
        of some limitations my body was putting on me. After working two to
        three jobs and raising children, I had accelerated my genetic condition,
        which I had no clue about at this time. This started a long process of
        me trying to find answers and the medical community just shrugging and
        telling me nothing was broken, so they couldn't fix it. I didn't want a
        fix, I wanted to understand, so I continually searched until one of my
        doctors finally figured out what was happening and helped me get my
        diagnosis. In 2014, I found out that I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a connective tissue disorder that is caused by
        the body's DNA not having the correct coding to make collagen, therefore
        it makes faulty collagen and affects every part of your body using this
        protein, from your tendons and ligaments to your digestive and
        neurological systems. It's a big syndrome with a lot of comorbidities.
        In other words, it causes a lot of other issues.
        <br /><br />
        I was devastated. I saw no way out. My body was going through what we in
        the chronic illness community call a flare, and I felt like my life was
        over. I mourned my dreams for myself, my goals, my life as I knew it. I
        mourned for my children, as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome has a 50/50 chance of
        being inherited. I was unlucky and have a 100% success rate for passing
        it on. Once we found out my children were affected, I set my mind to
        finding <strong>SOMETHING</strong> that could help, or at least keep
        them from getting as bad as I had. I met with many different doctors
        from many different specialties, and eventually, we started being able
        to manage my symptoms as well as get ahead of the children being
        symptomatic, and gradually I saw a light at the end of the dark tunnel.
        <br /><br />
        My husband started really encouraging me to find things that I was still
        able to do even on my worst days, and I tried many with no fruition,
        until it finally occurred to me that I still loved coding. About the
        same time, I saw an advertisement on Facebook for a nifty little app
        called
        <a href="http://careerkarma.com/" target="_blank">Career Karma.</a> The
        advertisement itself was gorgeous, and I became curious. SoI downloaded
        it. This was the defining moment that changed my life for the better.
        <br /><br />
        Career Karma is an app that connects you with people and resources to
        achieve your coding goals. Through their #21DayCKChallenge and their
        squads, you're connected with thousands of people who range from just
        starting coding to senior software developers and more. They also help
        connect you with boot camps that help you learn coding and the pertinent
        information you need to pursue your career. The idea is that you use the
        resources and better your life, and in turn, you help others on the app
        do the same -- hence Career Karma.
        <br /><br />
        Through this app, I was challenged but also encouraged. Since beginning
        my 21-day challenge I have not stopped pursuing my education in coding
        and am happy to announce that as of
        <time datetime="2020-01-28">January 28th, 2020</time>, I will be
        starting a yearlong boot camp at
        <a href="https://www.kenzie.academy/" target="_blank">Kenzie Academy</a>
        studying to be a UX (user experience) engineer. This is the start of a
        lifelong dream I had set aside but never forgotten, and for the first
        time in a long time, I feel free. This is the beginning of my career,
        and I couldn't be more excited. It's also something for my children to
        see and know that this disability may change a lot of things, but it
        doesn't change who we are at the core, and it definitely doesn't define
        our worth to the world. <br /><br />
        So there it is. My why is complex on the best of days, but I think that
        makes it more interesting in the long run. I'm here not only to help
        myself and my children, but to hopefully show others that no matter how
        daunting the task may seem, that with a little help we can all get to
        our dreams. It's not easy, but no one promised us easy when they told us
        to chase our dreams, just that it would be rewarding. So for now, I'm
        going to keep documenting this journey, sharing some tips and tricks I
        have found and have yet to find along the way, so that the next person
        might find all of this just a little bit more accessible. After all,
        isn't helping each other what being human is all about?
